# Zerodha Clone Frontend
As a practice work, I tried to build a clone of stock exhange platform. I used React for the frontend and react-router-dom for navigating. This project has another two parts dashboard and backend. In dashboard users can watch their stocks informations.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   https://github.com/ishitaajain22-tech/Zerodha-Clone

2. Navigate to project folder & install associated deepndencies
   ```bash
   cd folder_name
   npm install

3. Set up the dashboard and backend. For backend, dp "npm install" for installing dependencies and start the server.

4. Start the server.
   ```bash
    npm start

<br/>

> ⚠️**Note:** 
>- Start the frontend first, so that it can be run on port 5173 and then dashboard will automatically be on port 5174.
>- All the 3 folders (frontend, backend & dashboard) should be in a single folder.
